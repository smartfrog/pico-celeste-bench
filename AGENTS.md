# AGENTS.md

## What this repo is

A **benchmark**, not an app. It evaluates an agent's ability to produce a complete,
playable PICO-8 cartridge for a single-screen Celeste-like platformer. There is no
build system, package manager, or test suite — the "code" produced is a `.p8`
cartridge text file.

## Layout

- `prompts/celeste_like.md` — the full task spec given to the agent under test. This is
  the source of truth for requirements (header format, controls, dash mechanics, level
  rules, final checks). Read it before doing the task.
- `assets/sprites.png`, `assets/screenshot.png` — reference visuals the cartridge must
  resemble. Open and inspect them before drawing sprites.
- `results/*.p8` — example/produced cartridges (e.g. `qwen37.p8`), kept as reference.
- `carts/` — gitignored output directory for generated cartridges.

## The task workflow (when asked to build the cartridge)

1. Web-search the original Celeste Classic PICO-8 for reference (required first step).
2. Inspect `assets/sprites.png` and `assets/screenshot.png`.
3. Write the `.p8` file with the exact 3-line header, then a 3–6 line design-notes
   comment, then Lua + `__gfx__`/`__map__`.
4. Verify boot with: `timeout 10 pico8 -x <file>.p8 2>&1`
   - `pico8` is on PATH (`~/.local/bin/pico8`).
   - It runs forever on success, so the timeout firing is expected.
   - **Read the text output, not the exit code.** Only `RUNNING:` with no
     `syntax error` / `runtime error` line means a clean boot.
   - `-x` checks boot/syntax/runtime only — it does NOT validate gameplay or level
     solvability. Those must be correct by construction.
5. (Recommended) Play-test gameplay with the `pico8` MCP tools — see "Gameplay
   Self-Test" in the prompt: `pico8_boot` the cart, drive it frame-by-frame with
   `pico8_step`/`pico8_play`, verify state with `pico8_read`, and screenshot with
   `pico8_screen`. The MCP runs a temp copy; the graded file is never modified.
   (MCP server: https://github.com/smartfrog/pico8-mcp — fallback: the scripted
   `btn`/`btnp` harness on a /tmp copy, described in the prompt.)

## Cartridge file format (strict — harness reads the file, not chat)

- Line 1 exactly: `pico-8 cartridge // http://www.pico-8.com`
- Line 2 exactly: `version 8`
- Line 3 exactly: `__lua__`
- Then design-notes comment, then code. **Raw cartridge text only** — no Markdown,
  no code fences, no prose, no `#include`, fully self-contained.

## Gotchas

- Only the final saved file is graded; iterate freely with tools but leave the file clean.
- Never leave harness/debug code in the graded file; do all testing on copies in /tmp.
- Level solvability cannot be tested by the runner — make the dash-required obstacle and
  the main path correct by inspecting the tile grid, not by trial.
- The repo currently has no commits; don't assume git history for context.
